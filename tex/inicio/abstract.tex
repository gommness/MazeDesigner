The purpose of this documento is the development of a desktop application that eases videogame developers the task of level design for a specific videogame genre. This application will have a graphical interface in which users will be able to build the playable areas, define which regions of those areas make up the levels and instantiate a set of logic objects that will leave an underlying implicit logical structure in the design, that will be explored to determine whether or not it is well designed.

In this document the current tools available, the definition of the project itself, its design, its development and the conclusions and results will be discussed.
