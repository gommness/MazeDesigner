# MazeDesigner

This project has been developed as a final degree project for the university UAM (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid).

MazeDesigner is a game design tool that allows the user to create and export mazes for videogames that, in one way or another,
contain a maze. For example (but not only restricted to), any metroidvania or any Zelda-like game.
This tool also checks for certain correctness criteria in the design. Under these criteria, MazeDesigner ensures that no area of the
maze can become inaccesible due to an erroneous exploration done by the player.

So far, the tool only exports the maze to a GameMaker Studio 2 project. But it might be expanded in the future.
